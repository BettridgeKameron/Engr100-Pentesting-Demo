MAKE SURE SET UP IS GOOD BEFORE START (INCLUDING 2 ROOT TERMINALS IN THE TMP)

WHEN USING AIRPLAY AND AIRMON USE CHANNEL

SETUP: Connect ipad or some device to hackme, connect camera to ethernet(not inter). stream footage on device/ipad. MAKE SURE TO RESET CAMERA BEFOREHAND. Have two root shells prior to streaming. try not to flash password. FORGET ALL NETWORKS ON DEVICE WATCHING STREAM. remember: channel 5 should be set if you can config that, the ipad mac and router should be the exact same, so technically if you need more time you can write all of that. ALLOW ANON VIEWER FOR CAM.

DONT SUDO NMAP
