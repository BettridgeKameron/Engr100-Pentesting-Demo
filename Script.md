Hello Engr100, My name is Kameron and I am the president of the cyber club. Today I am going to go over and demonstrate a cybersecurity job known as pentesting. It is essentially when a company hires you to find vulnerabilities in their systems, in other words, they pay you to hack them. The tools mentioned here are only meant to be used for legal activity like pentesting.

I do have to mention that what I am showing is for educational purposes only, and that if you do attempt anything here without consent of the device owners, it is heavily illegal, and that I am using a method which can get you caught fairly quickly.

Now on to the fun stuff

for this demo, I will pretend that I am a pentester and was hired by some fictional company named Rainbow INC.

(~1 minute for above)

All companies now adays are connected to the internet, whether that is wireless or ethernet. One of the attack vectors hackers will probably use is the network, as if a company misconfigures, or insecurely sets it up, it can be a gold mine for them. So first I will try to find vulnerabilities in the network
For wifi security, there are a few main ones, the first is wep, and that is outdated as you can get the password using statistics no matter the complexity of the password, but some companies will unfortunately still use it. The next ones are WPA and WPA2 which is what I will be dealing with. This security basically relies on the security of the network password. Lastly there is WPA 3 which is nearly impossibly to crack, but still can be.

(~1 minute for above)

I am also able to do the following things because wireless traffic is actually all around us, most devices are just set up to only see theirs... but I will be purposefully setting my wificard to see my ipads traffic.
>do wifi demo, remember to ask for them not to connect to network

(~3 mins for above, if need more time literally copy and paste or reverse search)

(speak the following, maybe need to paraphrase while rebooting)

With this password I can connect to the network and see any other devices that are on the network. This means if any vulnerable devices are on the network, such as a database storing bank information, passwords, and the like, I would have full access to it as an attacker. When my computer is done rebooting, I will login to the network and look for other devices on the network. As an attacker I could use this knowledge to gain access to even more things I shouldnt have access to. We should be able to see this security camera on the network, which has a vulnerability which will allow us to take full control of the device. This is because the company failed to keep devices up to date, which is sadly common. Some companies either cant afford, or go by "if it aint broke, dont fix it".

(~2 mins for above, including reboot, and both nmap scans with short explaination)

Another thing of note is the reason why this and other vulnerabilities exist, is due to oversights in the software development stage. Like a developer forgetting to check inputs and the sort. As a software developer it is important that even small things dont go over looked, as even the smaller things can be combined together to do one big exploit chain, which is exactly what happened in this camera. Because of this, I am able to do anything I want on the camera, such as use it to hack other devices, run malware, or change the video feed.

Now if we look here (at my ipad), we can see the current video feed, which currently is just a drink and i can move in front of it and such in order to show that it is indeed still live. As a way to demo this vulnerability, and show what an attacker could do, I went ahead last night and wrote a script that will exploit this camera for me to change the camera feed to a still image of the can, although I could technically change it to anything I want. I will also have a page where only I can see the live feed.

Here is what the exploit looks like by the way if you are curious.
(~1:30 min for above)

Now we can go ahead and run this and you can see that there appears to be no changes.

>>>>>Adlib the whole can thing, it can change as idk if it camera will go white but some notes:
CTRL+F5 when refreshing, if the feed didnt go white and correctly froze, grab the can, then show that even during a refresh it will still show the can. Pull up the video feed on laptop with ipad still up to.
If no good places to put ipad, pull the feed up on laptop to show it, then go to url in new window/tab.

To conclude, I was able to find some vulnerabilities in this fictional company, and now I would go write a report on what I found, and any changes I would reccomend. Lastly I can not stress enough, do not do what I showed as it can be illegal without explicit consent. If you find this interesting, and want to learn and practice such skills in a safe and legal way and in competitions and such, consider joining the cyber club!

(~1:30 min for above)

All times were rounded up, but adding two minutes in case of any unexpected things will help

time to present: 10-12 minutes
