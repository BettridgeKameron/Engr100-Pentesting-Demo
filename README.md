# Engr100-Pentesting-Demo
Script.md is the final script for the presentation.

For this demonstration, in under a 12 minute time limit, it introduces students to the concept of penetration testing with a live demo.
It starts by explaining that one of the best ways to fix security issues is to know how to find them, i.e. think like a hacker, so by doing
so, there are a few ways a hacker might attempt to gain entry. The demo then talks briefly about wifi security and then shows the process
of cracking into a network due to an insecure password. Next it is explained that it is possible to see other devices connected to the
network, and by scanning it we find the vulnerable security camera (CVE-2018-10660 to CVE-2018-10662). It is then explained that due to poor
management and failure to update the security cameras it is possible to exploit the camera as show with metasploit or with the exploit.sh
script.
